    <!-- The <Rule> element below is a WS-MediationPolicy assertion that always
         routes messages to an alternate backend. A policy like this could be
         used to permanently route messages to an alternate backend while an
         upgrade is performed on the primary backend.
         
         Note: This is a template policy. Attaching this policy to a service will
               result in an error because the appliance will not be able to find
               "http://alternate-server:9080". This EndPoint value should be
               replaced with the desired alternate server endpoint.
