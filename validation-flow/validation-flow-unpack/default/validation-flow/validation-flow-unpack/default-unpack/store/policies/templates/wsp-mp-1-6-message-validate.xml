    <!-- The <Rule> element below is a WS-MediationPolicy assertion that validates
         a message using a schema called ValidateCustomerInfo.xsd. This
         should be replaced with the URL for the schema you want ValidateMssage to
         use.
         
         -If the same schema will be used by multiple services in different
          application domains on the appliance then the schema should be placed
          in store://
             examples:
                store://ValidateCustomerInfo.xsd
                store://schemas/ValidateCustomerInfo.xsd
                
         -If the schema is used only by services within the same application
          domain then the schema can be located in the local local: for that
          domain
             example:
                local:///ValidateCustomerInfo.xsd
                local:///myapp/schemas/ValidateCustomerInfo.xsd
         
         Note: This is a template policy. If this policy is attached to a service
               then the ValidateMessage function will not be able to find the
               ValidateCustomerInfo.xsd, an error will be logged, and a error
               response will be returned.
