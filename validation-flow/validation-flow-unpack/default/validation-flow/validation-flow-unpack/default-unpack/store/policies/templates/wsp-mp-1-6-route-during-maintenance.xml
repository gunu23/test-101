    <!-- The <Rule> element below is a WS-MediationPolicy assertion that routes
         messages to an alternate backend between midnight (00:00:00) and 3:00 in
         the morning (03:00:00) on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Such a policy
         would be useful routing messages to an alternate backend while the
         primary backend (determined by the gateway configuration) is unavailable
         due to routine maintenance or other factors.
         
         Tips:
               Remove the WeekDays element if the route should happen every day.

               Add Tuesday+Thursday to the Days attribute if maintenance is
               performed every weekday.

         Note:
               This is a template policy. Attaching this policy to a service will
               result in errors every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday between midnight
               and 3:00 because the appliance will not be able to find
               "http://offhours-server:9080". This EndPoint value should be
               replaced with the offhours server that you wish to specify.
