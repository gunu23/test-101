      <text>The remote tunnel address %1$s is colliding with the following Secure Cloud Connector instances: %2$s.</text>
      <summary />
      <description>Multiple remote endpoints are assigned the same private IP address. The private IP address with the list of Secure Cloud Connector instances are at the end of the message. Only one of the IP addresses will be routable, so traffic meant for one endpoint might be misdirected to another with the same address. This behavior can have serious functional and security consequences.</description>
      <suggestion>Ensure that the same private IP address is not assigned to multiple tunnels. Usually, this situation represents a configuration error.</suggestion>

      <summary />
      <description>Multiple interfaces on the remote endpoint are assigned the same IP address. If this is unintentional, it can interfere with source-based routing.</description>
      <suggestion>Validate that the IP addresses are assigned correctly.</suggestion>

      <text>The network interface to create the outbound connection is down.</text>
      <summary />
      <description>After verifying with multiple attempts, the network interface for the outbound connection is down.</description>
      <suggestion>Ensure that the routing table entry correctly reflects which interface to use to create the connection, and ensure that the interface is operational.</suggestion>
