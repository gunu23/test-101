        The ODR library state can change unexpectedly if it's connection to the REST service fails and failover occurs.
        If the ODR library remains in a state other than STARTED for an extended period of time, connectivity to WebSphere
        is not complete.  This may happen if one of the cells to which the ODR library is connected is completely down.
