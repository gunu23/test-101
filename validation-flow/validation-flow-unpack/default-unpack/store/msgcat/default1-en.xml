On the IBM 9235, the power supply LED should light solid or blinking green when there is AC power. The LED lit or blinking amber indicates some failure.</suggestion>

      <description>One of the power supplies has a failure. It might indicate that there is no AC power to the power supply, it might indicate that the power supply is missing, or it might indicate that the power supply has failed. If the green LED on the supply is not lit, the power supply has no AC power.</description>
