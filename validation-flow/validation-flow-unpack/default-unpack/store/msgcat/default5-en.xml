      <description>An HTTP transaction has been initiated by a client on an HTTP Proxy or XML firewall. The HTTP method requested by the client (GET, POST, etc.), the target host, and the client IP address are logged. If the HTTP version is 1.1, the target host will be the HTTP Host header value of the request. If the HTTP version is lower than 1.1, the reported target host depends on the HTTP Proxy or XML firewall configuration. If it is configured with a static backend URL, that is the target host reported. If it is configured to be dynamic, the target host cannot be determined at this logging point. If the client is using a persistent connection on HTTP, and this is not the first request on this HTTP connection, the 'conn use' will reflect the count of requests on this persistent HTTP connection, else it will be 1.</description>

      <summary>External FTP client violated Telnet NVT rules on control connection.</summary>
      <description>The FTP client being used to connect to the FTP Server component is violating the character encoding rules specified by the Telnet Network Virtual Terminal. The NVT "CR" character was received that was not followed by the NVT "LF" or "NUL" characters. This makes it impossible for the FTP Server to distinguish the end of a command line from embedded CR and LF characters in filenames. Since this server supports RFC 2640, it must see the NVT "end-of-line" sequence (CR followed by LF) at the end of each command line. It is quite likely that an FTP client causing this message will not interoperate with the FTP Server due to these NVT violations.</description>

A reason of "inappropriate address" indicates that it did not come from IP address 127.0.0.1. A reason of "external interface" indicates that it was not received on an internal interface. A reason of "non-transient program" indicates that the program was not in the transient range 0x40000000 - 0x5fffffff. The first two reasons cause an AUTH_TOOWEAK error to be returned.

      <description>The FTP client requested a write of a file to the server, using the STOR or STOU FTP command. The server indicated that transfer would begin, typically with a 150 result code, but then returned a subsequent failure result code (not starting with 1 or 2).</description>
      <suggestion>This is an unusual situation, as the FTP server decided to start the transfer, but it subsequently failed. One likely reason is that the FTP server ran out of disk space, or reached its disk quota limit. If the server is the DataPower FTP server, a failure of the associated transaction will cause the 150 followed by 451 result code pattern. Examine the response code and message from the server.</suggestion>

      <summary>Failed to read a file or directory from the FTP server.</summary>
      <description>The FTP client requested a read of a file or directory from the server, using the RETR, LIST, or NLST FTP command. The server indicated that transfer would begin, typically with a 150 result code, but then returned a subsequent failure result code (not starting with 1 or 2).</description>
      <suggestion>This is an unusual situation, as the FTP server decided to start the transfer, but it subsequently failed. One likely reason is that the FTP data connection failed before the FTP server could send the entire file. If the server is the DataPower FTP server, a failure of the associated transaction will cause the 150 followed by 451 result code pattern. Examine the response code and message from the server.</suggestion>

      <suggestion>This message indicates the failure to install a service on the configured local network address. The operational state of the service is down and it is not accepting new connections. The most likely cause is due to the use of an invalid host alias. If the service is using a host alias, verify that the host alias exists and its operational state is up.</suggestion>

      <summary>Error receiving quiesce notification response.</summary>
      <description>An error occurred while receiving a quiesce notification response. The quiesce notification expedites the quiescing phase of a server during a rollout. If the notification is not received, the rollout completion will not occur as rapidly as if notifications and responses are successful.</description>

      <summary>This error transaction took longer time to process than the configured delay duration and hence the error response is not delayed. Repeatedly not delaying the error response message after a decrypt action can provide enough information to an attacker using padding oracle method to determine the contents of the plain-text data.
