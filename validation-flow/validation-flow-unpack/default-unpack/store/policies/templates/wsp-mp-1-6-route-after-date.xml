    <!-- The <Rule> element below is a WS-MediationPolicy assertion that routes
         messages to an alternate backend starting on the date specified by the
         StartDate attribute (2012-06-01 = June 1, 2012).  A policy like this 
         this would be useful for routing messages to an new backend server at
         midnight the morning of June 1, 2012 because of a scheduled
         infrastructure upgrade. 
         
         Note: This is a template policy. Attaching this policy to a service will
               result in an error starting June 1, 2102 because the appliance
               will not be able to find "http://new-backend-server:9080".
               This EndPoint value should be replaced with the alternate server
               that you wish to specify.
