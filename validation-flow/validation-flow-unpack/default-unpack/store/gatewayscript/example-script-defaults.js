 * In a GatewayScript program, there is a predefined object: 'script' which is used
 * to access script level settings. It is available in both a GWS action script and
 * a module script. Currently, the 'script' object provides the following API:
 * 
 * - script.defaults(options)
 *   To change the script level settings. The "settings"' scope is the execution
 *   period of a GWS action.
 *   The following options are supported:
 *   - 'errorObjectLogging' : turn on/off the error log when GWS APIs throw an
 *      error object. The property is a boolean (true|false) and its default value
 *      is 'true'.
 * 
 * 
 * This example script shows how to change the 'errorObjectLogging' script
 * setting.

 * Read the 'input' as a JSON object. Because the 'errorObjectLogging' setting is
